üìå My Network Asset Inventory

This repository contains a structured network asset inventory for my home network. I created this to develop my cybersecurity knowledge, focusing on asset management, access control, and security best practices.

This document outlines my network-connected devices, their sensitivity classifications, and the security measures I‚Äôve implemented to protect my data.

| Asset             | Network Access | Owner        | Location       | Notes                                                                                                                             | Sensitivity Classification                     |
|------------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Network Router** | Continuous   | ISP         | On-premises   | The core of my home network. Uses **WPA3 encryption, firewall settings, and separate networks for IoT and guest devices**.      | **High - Critical Security Asset**          |
| **Desktop Computer** | Occasional | Myself      | On-premises   | Contains **financial records, personal files, and passwords**. I use **strong passwords and full-disk encryption** for security. | **High - Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Risk** |
| **Guest Smartphone** | Occasional | Friends     | On & Off-premises | Connects only to a **separate guest network** with limited internet access and no access to personal devices.                   | **Medium - Restricted Network Access**      |
| **PlayStation 5 (PS5)** | Occasional | Myself      | On-premises   | Stores **credit card details**. I have enabled **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** and keep my gaming account secure.           | **Medium - Payment Security Risk**          |
| **Wireless Printer** | Occasional | Myself      | On-premises   | **No sensitive data stored**, but I disabled **remote printing** from outside my network to prevent unauthorized access.        | **Low - Potential Attack Vector**           |
| **Smart TV** | Continuous   | Myself      | On-premises   | Uses streaming services but **does not store personal data**. Isolated on a separate network to reduce security risks.          | **Low - IoT Device Security Risk**          |


## üîπ Security Measures I‚Äôve Implemented  

As I learn more about cybersecurity, I am applying basic network security best practices to protect my devices.  

### üîí Network Security Enhancements  
- **Upgraded my router security** by enabling **WPA3 encryption** and disabling **WPS**.  
- **Created separate networks** for **IoT devices, guest users, and personal devices** to limit exposure.  
- **Turned off remote access and UPnP** to prevent unauthorized external connections.  

### üõ°Ô∏è Device Protection & Data Security  
- **Enabled full-disk encryption** on my desktop to protect sensitive data.  
- **Use strong, unique passwords** and **password managers** for online accounts.  
- **Set up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** on my gaming and cloud storage accounts.  

### üìå Access Control & Monitoring  
- **Restricted guest devices** to an **isolated network** to prevent access to my private files.  
- **Manually check router logs** for unknown devices or unusual activity.  
- **Keep all devices updated** by enabling **automatic software and firmware updates**.
